# Portfolidex

Portfolidex is a portfolio aggregation and visualization tool for DEX (Developer Experience) ecosystems. It automatically discovers, collects, and displays metadata from all registered DEX projects and modules, providing a unified, searchable view of your organizationâ€™s developer tools, apps, and reusable components.

## Features

- **Automatic Discovery:** Scans and aggregates metadata from DEX apps and modules.
- **Unified Portfolio:** Presents a searchable, filterable view of all registered projects.
- **Visualization:** Helps teams understand, showcase, and manage their internal developer ecosystem.
- **Integration:** Supports easy integration with DEX tools and modules.

## How It Works

1. **Registration:** Each DEX app or module includes a `.portfolidex.json` metadata file.
2. **Aggregation:** Portfolidex scans for these files and collects project information.
3. **Visualization:** The site displays all discovered projects in a unified portfolio dashboard.
